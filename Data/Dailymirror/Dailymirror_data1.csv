"Academic activities in some 26 schools located in the Kinniya district in Trincomalee has come to a standstill today due to a protest staged by the teachers in the said schools.
Due to the absence of teachers, the Principals of the 26 schools have allegedly taken measures to send the children back home. The teachers have boycotted work today to urge the Police to arrest a Kinniya provincial council member who had allegedly assaulted the Kinniya Zonal Education Director last evening.
Two suspects have been arrested with relation to the incident and several more are due to be arrested including the provincial council member in question.

"Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) is neither supporting nor opposing the abolition of the proposed rotation policy for the International Cricket Council (ICC) president, said SLC interim committee chairman, DS deSilva.
Speaking exclusively at the hotel here on Tuesday late evening, he said: ""If the issue comes on voting in the AGM here on Wednesday, we are going to abstain from the voting. The decision has nothing to do with the Indian cricket board's decision of not sending the players for the Sri Lanka Premier League (SLPL) in Colombo next month. I had a long chat with the BCCI president and secretary, Shashank Manohar and N Srinivasan on players' participation for the first edition of the league. I am sadden by their decision and hope if their stand still gets changed in days to come.""
The BCCI's move to ouster the next ICC vice president (and then the president) is clearly to keep the man from any of Bangladesh and Pakistan for holding this key post. ""How can Ijaz Butt dream of becoming the ICC president when he is not able to run the board in his own country"", one of the former BCCI official, said to this scribe here.
According to the sources, the BCCI is keen to have Shashank Manohar for this post in future. The PCB chairman, Ijaz Butt, had a long discussion with the ECB chairman Giles Clark and their points of decision is unlikely to have only been restricted to Pakistan's ‘home series’ against England at the neutral venue.

"The United States on Tuesday urged Sri Lanka to move quickly to address allegations of war crimes, warning of rising pressure for international action if it does not.
The State Department stopped short of endorsing calls for an international investigation into the bloody finale of the island's civil war in 2009, saying that domestic authorities have primary responsibility to ensure accountability.
'We continue to urge the government of Sri Lanka to quickly demonstrate that it is able and willing to meet these obligations as it seeks reconciliation,' a State Department statement said.
'We hope the Sri Lankans will themselves do this, but if they do not, there will be growing pressure from the international community to examine other options,' it said.
Pressure has mounted on Sri Lanka since Britain's Channel 4 broadcast a documentary that showed what it said were prisoner executions and bodies of female Tamil fighters who appeared to have been sexually assaulted.
The United Nations has said that up to 7,000 civilians were killed in the final months of the fighting and a recent UN report accused government forces of executing rebel leaders who were said to have worked out a surrender. An estimated 100,000 people were killed in the nearly four-decade-long Tamil separatist conflict, which began in 1972.

The Petroleum Ministry yesterday said around 100 to 150 complaints were received regarding engine performance being affected after pumping petrol from several outstation Ceypetco petrol stations.
Secretary, Ministry of Petroleum Industries Titus Jayawardena told Daily Mirror online that the Ministry had already launched an inquiry into the complaints and that in no way does the government import substandard fuel.
After initial reports were received regarding engine performance being affected in motorcycles and trishaws after pumping petrol from the said Ceypetco petrol outlets, samples were collected and tested in the labs, Jayawardena said
Fifteen samples were collected and tested, thirteen out of them were 100 % in compliance with the Ceypetco quality compliance while two from Kuliyapitiya and Seruwila  had slight differences, Jayawardena added.
There are more than 2.1 million motorcycles in the country and 539,000 trishaws in operation islandwide, in total around 2.6 million and the reported 100-150 vehicles affected by engine performance are minute and could have occurred for different reason as well.
Mr. Jayawardena added that some elements had blown the issue out of proposition to defame the government and Ceypetco as some had loss business due to the lack of middlemen in importing the fuel consignments, which was a direct deal between the Emirates State oil Company and the government.
Furthermore, he added the slight difference in petrol quality would have occurred due to fuel being pumped from the tanks after it reached what is known as “dead stock” where water and other impurities also exist.

About 30 acres of forest land in Digampathana in Sigiriya were completely destroyed by a fire that ravaged the area, police media spokesman Prishantha Jayakody said.
He said the fire was finally doused by forest officers who were assisted by the Dambulla Urban Council fire Brigade, the Sigiriya police and villagers.
SP Jayakody said investigations were being conducted to find out how Monday evening’s fire, which destroyed more than 500 valuable plants, had originated.
He said no injuries or casualties to anyone in the area had been reported. The Forest Conservation Department said the fire had spread rapidly because of the dry weather conditions prevailing in the area and the difficulty in accessing the area devastated by fire contributed to the delay in extinguishing it.
